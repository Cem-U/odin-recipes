        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Learn how to make French fries that are super crispy with this twice-fried method. I don't think most people realize that any decent French fry needs to be fried twice. The first frying is done at a lower temperature, which softens the potato and prepares the starchy surface for the second frying's crispification.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying, about 2 cups or as needed</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak potato stips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally.</li>
            <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate let cool completely.</li>
            <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
